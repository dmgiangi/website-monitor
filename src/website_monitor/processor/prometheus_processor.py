"""
Prometheus metrics processor for the website monitoring system.

This module defines a processor that could export monitoring results as Prometheus metrics.
It serves as an example of how the system can be extended with additional result processors
to integrate with external monitoring and observability systems.

class PrometheusProcessor(ResultProcessor):
    """A processor that would export monitoring results as Prometheus metrics.

    This class is a placeholder implementation that demonstrates the extension
    capabilities of the monitoring system. In a real implementation, it would
    export metrics like response time, status codes, and regex match results
    to a Prometheus metrics endpoint.

    The processor would typically integrate with the Prometheus Python client
    library to create and update metrics such as:
    - Counters for tracking total requests, errors, and status codes
    - Histograms for measuring response time distributions
    - Gauges for tracking current state of regex matches

    These metrics would then be exposed via an HTTP endpoint that Prometheus
    could scrape at regular intervals.

    Note:
        This class is not fully implemented and serves as a demonstration of
        how the system could be extended to integrate with Prometheus.
