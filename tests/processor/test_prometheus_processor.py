"""
Unit tests for the PrometheusProcessor class.

This module contains comprehensive tests for the PrometheusProcessor class,
ensuring that it correctly handles monitoring results for export as Prometheus metrics.
Note that since the PrometheusProcessor is a placeholder implementation, these tests
primarily verify that the methods exist and don't raise exceptions.

The tests follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern and use proper mocking
of all external dependencies to ensure true unit testing.
